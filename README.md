## What This Project Does

The Growth Opportunity Finder is a dashboard tool that helps Payplug increase revenue by showing:

1. Which merchants are likely to buy more of our services
2. What features we should offer to specific merchants
3. How our different merchant groups (segments) are performing
4. Why some merchants are more successful than others

The dashboard has a fun retro gaming style that makes data exploration more enjoyable.
